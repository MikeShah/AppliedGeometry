# Journal Entry

Part of being a researcher is being a good note taker of what you learn, and surveying what work has been done by others. Ultimately this course will culminate into a final project in the geometry domain, and I'd like you to start thinking and exploring early on.

## Step 1 - Record your knowledge as you build expertise.

In this section, I'd like you to record what your takeaways have been from this week. What *exactly* did you learn?

e.g. You might write about the art gallery theoreom or triangulation here. What was interesting about what you learned? Can you list some facts (i.e. maybe complexity of an algorithm, or how the problem works).

*Record your learnings here*

One thing I'd like you to also think about is the 'isLeft' function in this part0 demo code. The given function 'works', but how? How would you explain it to someone so that they could have intuition about telling if a point is to the 'left' of a line segment.

*Record your intuition about isLeft*

## Step 2 - What is the state of the art

For this section, I'd like you to do some searching for 'triangulation' (or adjacent items) as related to computational geometry. Search the web (google scholar, YouTube, Game Developer Conference Talks, SIGGRAPH, etc.) and try to find work related to 'triangulation' of geometry. Write a few sentences/paragraphs about what you have learned here.

*Record your learnings here*

### Notes

The grading of this is a completion exercise. As we proceed further through the semester you will eventually do a more formal writeup as we become more familiar with computational geometry.
